# inventory-oop

## Project Description
This task uses object-oriented programming and functions to read an external text file, inventory.txt, to create shoe objects which can be viewed and updated.
Additional shoe objects can also be created by the user and all changes are then rewritten back to the inventory.txt file. 
The menu format allows for an interactive and well-formatted experience and structured, readable code that is sectioned in 3 parts: the class & methods, functions and the menu.

## Instructions
* Download the inventory.py file as well as the inventory.txt file
* They must be in the same directory/file location.
* In your ide, eg. VS code or Pycharm, open both files.
* Ensure that the text file has shoe data in it. ( inventory.txt)
* Run the inventory.py file and follow the menu prompts.
* You do not need additional plugins, etc for this project - only your ide.
* Be sure to read and comprehend the prompts before answering your questions.

Thank you!
